# story.board

##prolog

This project is created within a weekend on thehackathon  #djhack which was hosted from the medialab bayern (http://medialab-bayern.de/). The topic of the hackathon was "DIGITAL JOURNALISM HACKATHON" and the challenges "Chat Bots" and "360 Degrees Videos".

##content

story.board helps to transfer scrum principles to the newsroom and improve the worksflows by removing inefficiencies. Editors-in-chief now donâ€™t have to wait till all the stories flow in shortly before the deadline but can read the stories chunk by chunk and give immediate feedback.

For this reason, story.board gives the leader article/project owner the opportunity to create different chunks of his/her article and split it up into different work packages or backlog story points. These story points can be assigned to different persons and each of them has its own state on the kanban board. Possible states can be "to do", "in progress", "in review" and "done". One of the most important features is the in review state, because this is the state where the editor-in-chief gets notified that a chnunk is ready for a review. This enables the editor to review each chnunk, when its done instead of when the whole article/project is finished. This is kinda an application of the customer oriented development with scrum.

##technologies

For the frontend we used angular js and as a base for the layouting and styling the LTEAdmin Template which is based on bootstrap. The angular js application structure is developed for a minimalistic beginning.
